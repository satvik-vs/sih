**SMART INDIA HACKATHON**

**Problem Statement :**
Air and water quality index and environment monitoring
**Description:**
Considering the importance of air and water to human existence, air pollution and water pollution are critical issues that require collective effort for prevention and control. Different types of anthropogenic activities have resulted in environmental dilapidation and ruin. One of the tools that can be used for such a campaign is Air Quality Index (AQI). The AQI was based on the concentrations of different pollutants: We are also familiar with the Water Quality Index (WQI), which in simple terms tells what the quality of drinking water is from a drinking water supply. There is a need for constant and continuous environment monitoring of air quality and water quality for the development of AQI and WQI, which in turn will enable clear communication of how clean or unhealthy the air and water in the study area is.
